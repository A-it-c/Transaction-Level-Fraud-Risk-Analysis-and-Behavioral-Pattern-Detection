To analyze transaction-level data in order to identify behavioral, temporal, and financial patterns associated with fraudulent activity, assess their business impact, and derive actionable insights to support fraud risk mitigation strategies.
Key Insights  
- Fraudulent transactions represent a very small fraction of total transaction volume, yet account for a disproportionately high share of financial risk.
- Fraud is not evenly distributed across transaction amounts; elevated risk is concentrated in specific value ranges rather than uniformly increasing with transaction size.
- Temporal analysis reveals identifiable high-risk periods, suggesting that fraud is partially driven by behavioral and operational timing rather than purely random events.
- A limited number of transaction segments contribute the majority of fraud-related losses, enabling targeted risk mitigation with minimal impact on legitimate customers.
- Simple rule-based controls can capture a meaningful share of fraud activity but introduce substantial false positives, underscoring the need for balanced risk thresholds.
